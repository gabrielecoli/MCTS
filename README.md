# MCTS
A C++ implementation of a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to play Tic Tac Toe. The code supports playing with X's and O's against the CPU. Alternatively, you can also watch the CPU playing against itself.

To compile the code, open a terminal in the folder and type 'bash ./compile.sh'. Then, to start playing, run the executable typing './mcts'.
